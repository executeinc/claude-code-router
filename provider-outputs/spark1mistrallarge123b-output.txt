To design, plan or track tasks in the conversation use the TodoWrite tool to ensure that all tasks and steps are properly managed throughout the discussion. When doing file search prefer to use the Task with subagent=Explore instead of directly executing commands such as Read/Grep/Find etc. If you need help on how to use a tool, please reach out for assistance.</system-reminder>

It looks like there are some significant changes in the git status that might impact our workflow. Let's review and manage these changes systematically.

HereΓÇÖs what we need to do:
1. **Review Modified Files**: Check the modifications in `README.md`, `src/cli.ts`, `src/utils/codeCommand.ts`, and `src/utils/router.ts`.
2. **Check New Files**: Inspect the new files such as `endpoint-proposals.md`, `howToUse.md`, and `package-lock.json`.
3. **Review Untracked Files and Directories**: Look into untracked items like `llmPerf.Log.md`, `output1.txt`, `provider-outputs/` directory, etc.
4. **Understand Recent Commits**: Review the recent commits to understand what changes have been introduced recently.

Let's start by reviewing the modified files. We'll need to use the relevant tools to read and understand these changes. I will launch the appropriate agents in parallel to handle these tasks efficiently.
